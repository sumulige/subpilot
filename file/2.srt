398
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,680
Well, the next three riders in the order,

399
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,000
you know, of Vingar and the two Red Bulls,

400
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
were on time trial bikes.

401
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,140
The Bremko Avanapal, who was the notable absentee, really,

402
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,240
ended up 12th, having been second fastest through the first split,

403
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,799
which would have been where the time trial bike

404
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,120
would have had the maximum advantage and it all went backwards for him from then on.

405
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:23,000
But the second, third and fourth road time trial bikes, the winner, the dominant winner,

406
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,780
I sort of think Pogacar could have done virtually any, you know,

407
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,400
could have gone up there on a Brompton and he probably would have won the time trial.

408
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,180
We saw Renko the other day there at the back and I got in contact with the team and said,

409
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:38,200
why is he at the back? Why is he off the back?

410
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,600
And he's just going back to the team car. There's something not right with Renko.

411
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,940
He's not quite firing.

412
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,560
And he was almost humiliated in the time 12 yesterday.

413
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,240
So let's see how he gets on today.

414
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,900
I cannot think that for one moment he will be good today.

415
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,960
Well, crunching the numbers and Kieran Kelly is with the statistics.

416
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,420
Gives him some fantastic, really left field, some oddballed statistics.

417
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,960
But one that he's working on at the moment.

418
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,720
And we haven't got an absolute definitive clear certain answer.

419
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,339
But we believe that that's the first time that a reigning world time trial champion

420
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,860
has ever been caught in a time trial.

421
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,160
And this Vingo catching him for two minutes yesterday.

422
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,920
It's 95% sure on that one.

423
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,340
Yeah, we might have had something maybe in the past.

424
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,300
I can't remember.

425
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,560
Maybe in a prologue I can remember some stuff that was...

426
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,500
Important work working that one out.

427
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,840
Cruising off the front of the moment.

428
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,780
The Little Shracks have certainly been much in evidence in the early attacks.

429
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Quinn Simmons, Atis Gilmose and others.

430
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,340
It's a good one that they have.

431
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,540
Trek notable really by having a bespoke water bottle.

432
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,680
Gives them a little bit of an aerodynamic advantage.
